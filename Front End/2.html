   CHILDHOOD </header>
  <p id="p2">
    I started my schooling in Geetanjali Public School. I enjoyed my childhood days alot. My 
parents used to pamper me alot.I am the younger one in my house. I used to have a lot of fascination to cricket 
since my childhood. My schooling in Geetanjali went good and I have been well in studies till my 5th.</p>
  <header id="head3">
  MAD AT MATH AND CRICKET </header>
  <p id="p3">
   I have gone to Bhashayam at my 11. Then my view to Math has really changed. Math became my favourite and I
   was addicted to it. I was very interested in watching and playing cricket. Viru is my idol. I used to watch 
   cricket restlessly whenever I get time and my fascination to cricket has increased day by day. </p>
 <header id="head4">HOSTEL LIFE- A NEW ERA!</header>
  <<p id="p4">> Then it just really happened like, I have joined Sri Chaitanya Techno School, Vishakhapatnam. Hostel life is
  very new to me and I was very excited by being self-decisioned. I continued my passion and interest towards math.
  Hostel life made to me explore all the happiness and my game cricket.I was promoted to a new batch at the end 
  of my eigth.</p>
  <header id="head5"> HYDERABADI</header>
  <<p id="p5">> In my 10th,I was again changed to Hyderabad-Nallakunta branch.My attitude, my slang, my way of speaking has 
  really changed after coming to Hyderabad. Being a hyderabadi is a wonderful experience. I love that place and
  I am really missing my friends over there. The places in hyderabad mesmorised me a lot. </p>
  <header id="head6">TOUGH TIMES</header>
     <p id="p6"> Life at hyderabad made me jump into the mode of enjoyment and gradually my scores in exams decreased. I am
	  very depressed and I was unable to handle the pressure.</p>
<header id="head7"> BEST DAYS-DAYS OF FUN </header>
     <p id="p7"> I have tried alot to overcome the pressure and finally discovered the secret behind success. I started
enjoying my life and studying in parallel. I bunked the college and went to many movies. I have gone second shows
by jumping the mighty wall of sri chaitanya hostel. I enjoyed alot and I miss those days and the company given
by my friends.We were caught by our management twice and thrice but those are the most funny memories ever.</p>
<header id="head8"> CRACKED IIT </header><p id="p8">
 Finally I cracked IIT. I am very satisfied with my department and the branch. Thanks to all my friends,college 
 and my family.</p>
 <header id="head9"> YO KGP! </header>
  <p id="p9">And it is the time to say "YO KGP". I loved the college and it has made me to explore many things in just a
  year. Hope I do well in the coming years.</p>
